  <h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
  <p>Dear @Model.GetRecipient(),</p>
  <p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm learning programming while in Iceland! </p>
  <p>@Model.GetRecipient(), you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to @Model.GetLocation() instead.</p>
  <p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
  <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir, @Model.GetItems(). </p>
  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Travel Enthusiast Jane</p>
